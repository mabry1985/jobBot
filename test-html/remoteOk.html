We've started with the automation and streamlining of day-to-day operations carried out by online retailers.

At Vavato we are building a development team from scratch to further the development of our auction platform, initially built by a 3rd party agency.\n\nYou will join our brand new IT department and team, have a high degree of responsibility and freedom to execute your job, and high impact on a rocket ship growth organization.\n\nCulture\n\nWork hard, play hard! At Vavato you will find a relaxed, casual atmosphere (and occasionally see post it blocks flying down the hallway in an attempt to punish a bad joke). We are young in spirit and lighthearted, but work hard to reach our goals.&nbsp;\n\nWe expect everyone to take initiative and point out things we could be doing better or could do to improve the #HAPPYVAVATO experience for our buyers and sellers. Our trio of CEO's is always happy to listen to your concerns and implement the best ideas. Together we are smarter and stronger.\n\nYou\n\nWe are looking for highly motivated individuals willing to be part of a growing start-up / scale-up adventure. We expect you to take full ownership of your work, work hard, especially when needed - production issues can occur and have to be tackled, issues arise daily that require immediate attention to avoid hurting the company's bottom line. We try to structure work as best as we can, but sometimes you will have to cope with chaos.\n\nWe expect you to help carry the load and the company forward.&nbsp; There is plenty of room for learning and growth in our team, and we're just starting out. The intention is to make this company 10x bigger than it is today. Plenty of opportunities will be available down the road for people who are willing and capable.\n\nWe also expect you to have fun, love your job, love our customers, and enjoy the company of your colleagues ;)\n\nPractices / Values\n\n\n* We deploy multiple times a day to production with zero downtime using Continuous Delivery\n\n* We follow the open source model with our CTO being the benevolent dictator on the product and everyone contributing through pull requests\n\n* We believe in the values of Software Craftsmanship and do things "the right way", even under pressure.\n\n* We work directly with the stakeholders within the company without any proxy between the people who need a feature and the people working on it\n\n* We do unit testing, integration testing, black box testing and testing spanning the whole stack. This way you know that code that hits master is production ready.\n\n* We use Kanban and release features as they become ready, without ever doing big bang releases and without creating "a release".\n\n* All of your code will be reviewed by a peer before being put into production to accelerate your learning and for your own ease of mind\n\n* Everything in our infrastructure is scripted either through Terraform or Ansible to ensure reproducible builds and to be disaster proof\n\n* We have hourly full backups of the database in case anything goes wrong\n\n* We have tested our disaster recovery plan extensively\n\n* We use trunk-based development, our branches are very short lived, and we employ feature toggles to ship code to production as early as possible without making it visible to users\n\n\n\n\nStack\n\nWe don't expect you to know everything in the list, but the more the merrier. In the end, what really counts is your willingness to learn and capacity to solve problems in an efficient and simple way.

Development managers are not just managers, as they are expected to commit code, but at a different pace than contributing engineers. This is our flagship development team and the opportunity to lead a group of very talented and motivated software engineers.\n\nAs Development Manager of the Java Agent team you have a number of responsibilities, but the primary one is to ship product out the door. Your goal is deliver results to the customer and market. To do this you need to make sure the development team is able to work as efficiently as possible and this means making sure they have clear goals, both short term and long term, and that nothing prevents them from doing their work. From the initial project scope to deploying the product out to customer sites, each step is your responsibility. You can, and should, delegate as much as you can but be ready to check that things are being done as you want and be ready to jump in if it is not.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\n\n* Own your product and software code base, including the feature road map, customer issues/defects and the technology road map.\n\n* Lead up cross-functional development project initiatives owning project management, issue tracking, scoping and planning.\n\n* Collaborate with the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development team to deliver a high-value, first class security product.\n\n* Drive the daily standup meeting with the team to ensure the project is on-track and that issues are resolved timely.\n\n* Support all hiring and recruiting initiatives for your team.\n\n* Work on technical designs and architectural initiatives on a project by project basis.\n\n* Manage individuals supporting their personal/career growth and development.\n\n* Develop team and individual goals/objectives that align to the department and company goal\n\n* Perform consistent and regular individual one on one meetings with team members.\n\n* Be a team player. You love to work with others to find the right solutions.\n\n\n\n\nAbout You\n\n\n* You love to manage others and make them better developers.\n\n* You love to code and deploy at scale.\n\n* Desire to make the Internet a safer place.\n\n* You approach problems from a product perspective, thinking through how the user will interact with what you're building.\n\n* You have strong communication skills. You ask questions, let others know when you need help, and tell others what you need.\n\n* You're a problem solver. You believe the best work is the result of finding the simplest solution to complex challenges.\n\n* You see the big picture. You understand how the code you write interacts with systems and services, both internally and externally.\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n\n* Competitive compensation\n\n* Daily team lunches\n\n* Meaningful stock plans\n\n* Medical, dental, and vision benefits\n\n* Flexible paid time off\n\n\n</div></div><div class="instructions"><p style="text-align:center">See more jobs at <a target="_new" href="/remote-companies/contrast-security">Contrast Security</a></p><a class="button action-apply" href="/l/76696" target="_new" rel="nofollow">Apply for this Job</a><p style="font-size:0.85em"><strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here!</strong><br /><br />When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply.

As our team grows, we want to make sure that this is the case, which means working on interesting and rewarding challenges!\n\nOne of our priorities in terms of team happiness is to optimise team scheduling. We&rsquo;re a remote-first company distributed across many continents, and as a result, scheduling meetings and ensuring we always have engineers available to support our users is a difficult challenge.\n\nWe believe it&rsquo;s important to ensure that every member of the team is able to choose their working hours and maintain a healthy work-life balance, which means taking these parameters into account when scheduling.\n\nAs you may have read on our&nbsp;blog, we achieve this through the use of advanced constraint programming algorithms. This turns a task which would be tedious and inefficient to do by hand into a rewarding mathematical challenge which simultaneously results in a better and more flexible outcome for our team.\n\nAlgorithmic scheduling is of course just one example of pain reduction for the team. We have more ideas on how tools like constraint solvers can be applied to boost team happiness and success, for example the optimisation of team activities and professional development.\n\nWe are looking for a full stack &ldquo;team happiness&rdquo; engineer to join us in this venture by innovating and implementing engineering solutions to reduce discomfort and friction across our team. We can&rsquo;t wait to see what you can come up with!\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n* Extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\n\n* The software engineering skills to implement these solutions programmatically.\n\n* The ability to execute and complete software projects.\n\n* Good understanding of software engineering practices and how to apply them (e.g. version control, tests, descriptive commit messages).\n\n* Self-motivation to find the best possible outcome from a myriad of options.\n\n* Desire to make yourself and others more effective; you&rsquo;d be bothered by an inefficient process.\n\n* Excellent written communication skills, and fluency in English.\n\n* The ability to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\n\n* The candour to question the status quo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice to have:\n\n\n* Experience with Linux, TypeScript, JavaScript frameworks, Python, HTML\/CSS and databases\n\n* Experience with Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, and managing projects on the Google Cloud Platform.\n\n* A good understanding of git and GitHub.\n\n* An interest in mathematical modelling, optimisation and constraint solvers.\n\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample).\n\n* Experience in a full stack developer role.\n\n* Having worked remotely before.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout working at balena\n\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location.

As our team grows, we want to make sure that this is the case, which means working on interesting and rewarding challenges!\n\nOne of our priorities in terms of team happiness is to optimise team scheduling. We&rsquo;re a remote-first company distributed across many continents, and as a result, scheduling meetings and ensuring we always have engineers available to support our users is a difficult challenge.\n\nWe believe it&rsquo;s important to ensure that every member of the team is able to choose their working hours and maintain a healthy work-life balance, which means taking these parameters into account when scheduling.\n\nAs you may have read on our&nbsp;blog, we achieve this through the use of advanced constraint programming algorithms. This turns a task which would be tedious and inefficient to do by hand into a rewarding mathematical challenge which simultaneously results in a better and more flexible outcome for our team.\n\nAlgorithmic scheduling is of course just one example of pain reduction for the team. We have more ideas on how tools like constraint solvers can be applied to boost team happiness and success, for example the optimisation of team activities and professional development.\n\nWe are looking for a full stack &ldquo;team happiness&rdquo; engineer to join us in this venture by innovating and implementing engineering solutions to reduce discomfort and friction across our team. We can&rsquo;t wait to see what you can come up with!\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n* Extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\n\n* The software engineering skills to implement these solutions programmatically.\n\n* The ability to execute and complete software projects.\n\n* Good understanding of software engineering practices and how to apply them (e.g. version control, tests, descriptive commit messages).\n\n* Self-motivation to find the best possible outcome from a myriad of options.\n\n* Desire to make yourself and others more effective; you&rsquo;d be bothered by an inefficient process.\n\n* Excellent written communication skills, and fluency in English.\n\n* The ability to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\n\n* The candour to question the status quo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice to have:\n\n\n* Experience with Linux, TypeScript, JavaScript frameworks, Python, HTML/CSS and databases\n\n* Experience with Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, and managing projects on the Google Cloud Platform.\n\n* A good understanding of git and GitHub.\n\n* An interest in mathematical modelling, optimisation and constraint solvers.\n\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample).\n\n* Experience in a full stack developer role.\n\n* Having worked remotely before.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout working at balena\n\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\n\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies.

Chances are if you&rsquo;ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand&rsquo;s app or website, we&rsquo;ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We&rsquo;re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants&rsquo; POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\n\nThe Software Infrastructure engineering team at Olo is responsible for the cross-cutting software services and frameworks that enable our product engineering teams to iterate on ideas quickly and deliver reliable services at scale. With Olo&rsquo;s rise as a key player in restaurant e-commerce (you likely have used our services, even if you didn&rsquo;t realize it!), we are exploring new architectural paradigms and approaches to enable our future growth. Olo has built a reputation for reliability, and our Software Infrastructure team serves a key role in delivering that exceptional reliability at an ever-increasing scale.\n\nAs Engineering Manager, you will lead a team of talented engineers in the day-to-day development of new platform services and frameworks. At Olo, we value outcomes over output, and seek a leader who can help us understand the broader needs of our product engineering teams and deliver solutions to meet those needs. You will help develop and align the team&rsquo;s vision, guide their execution, remove impediments to the team&rsquo;s progress, and coach them to develop and grow both their skills and impact. You will foster a culture of collaboration, communication, accountability, skill sharing, belonging, mutual respect, and curiosity.\n\nWe expect our Engineering Managers to be seasoned engineers with the technical experience to both guide and challenge their teams to build robust, high-performing solutions. As a servant leader, your focus will be on facilitating strong team outcomes, hiring and developing engineering talent, and ensuring that our systems are ready to support emerging business priorities. While your primary focus will not be one of designing and developing software, we expect our engineering managers to have a strong software development foundation to be able to effectively guide their teams. As such we expect you to have demonstrable experience in software development that spans architecture and design, coding, quality best practices, and production operational concerns.\n\nOur technology stack is rooted in .NET and SQL Server running in an AWS infrastructure, and we leverage modern software engineering tools such as GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Datadog, and Sumo Logic, as well as heavy use of OSS.\n\nThis is a full-time position. Candidates may work at Olo&rsquo;s headquarters in New York City&rsquo;s Financial District, or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than 75% of our engineering team is remote!\n\nDesired Experience\n\n\n* A&nbsp; passion for computing that extends beyond work\n\n* At least 8 years of software development experience with a progression to a senior technical level\n\n* At least 3 years of engineering management experience under an Agile operational model\n\n* Demonstrated ability to build and mentor a high performance team while seeking continuous improvement\n\n* Ability to translate business priorities into viable technology solutions, and deliver\n\n* Experience in, and good understanding of, large scale, highly performant, distributed systems architecture and principles\n\n* Experience developing realistic project plans, managing stakeholder expectations, and tracking team execution\n\n* Experience instrumenting, deploying, and monitoring production code to enable timely incident detection and response\n\n* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)\n\n* Experience managing distributed teams consisting largely of remote engineers\n\n* BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience\n\n* Excellent English writing and verbal communication skills\n\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Olo\n\nOlo powers digital ordering and delivery programs that connect restaurant brands to the on-demand world, placing orders directly into the restaurant through all order origination points &ndash; from a brand&rsquo;s own website or app, third party marketplaces, social media platforms, smart speakers, and home assistants. Olo serves as the on-demand ordering and delivery platform across 70,000 locations for over 300 brands, such as Applebee&rsquo;s, Checkers &amp; Rally&rsquo;s, Cheesecake Factory, Chili&rsquo;s, Dairy Queen, Denny&rsquo;s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Portillo&rsquo;s Hot Dogs, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.

Chances are if you&rsquo;ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand&rsquo;s app or website, we&rsquo;ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We&rsquo;re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants&rsquo; POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\n\nThe Software Infrastructure engineering team at Olo is responsible for the cross-cutting software services and frameworks that enable our product engineering teams to iterate on ideas quickly and deliver reliable services at scale. With Olo&rsquo;s rise as a key player in restaurant e-commerce (you likely have used our services, even if you didn&rsquo;t realize it!), we are exploring new architectural paradigms and approaches to enable our future growth. Olo has built a reputation for reliability, and our Software Infrastructure team serves a key role in delivering that exceptional reliability at an ever-increasing scale.\n\nAs Engineering Manager, you will lead a team of talented engineers in the day-to-day development of new platform services and frameworks. At Olo, we value outcomes over output, and seek a leader who can help us understand the broader needs of our product engineering teams and deliver solutions to meet those needs. You will help develop and align the team&rsquo;s vision, guide their execution, remove impediments to the team&rsquo;s progress, and coach them to develop and grow both their skills and impact. You will foster a culture of collaboration, communication, accountability, skill sharing, belonging, mutual respect, and curiosity.\n\nWe expect our Engineering Managers to be seasoned engineers with the technical experience to both guide and challenge their teams to build robust, high-performing solutions. As a servant leader, your focus will be on facilitating strong team outcomes, hiring and developing engineering talent, and ensuring that our systems are ready to support emerging business priorities. While your primary focus will not be one of designing and developing software, we expect our engineering managers to have a strong software development foundation to be able to effectively guide their teams. As such we expect you to have demonstrable experience in software development that spans architecture and design, coding, quality best practices, and production operational concerns.\n\nOur technology stack is rooted in .NET and SQL Server running in an AWS infrastructure, and we leverage modern software engineering tools such as GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Datadog, and Sumo Logic, as well as heavy use of OSS.\n\nThis is a full-time position.

Olo serves as the on-demand ordering and delivery platform across 70,000 locations for over 300 brands, such as Applebee&rsquo;s, Checkers &amp; Rally&rsquo;s, Cheesecake Factory, Chili&rsquo;s, Dairy Queen, Denny&rsquo;s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Portillo&rsquo;s Hot Dogs, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.

Do animations, interactions, and user experiences delight you? Are you disciplined enough to work in sprints, but also mature enough to work independently?\n\nUndefined LLC is hiring a full-time FED to work on customer-facing and internal websites and web applications. Say goodbye to the agency or freelance rat race - you&rsquo;ll be working exclusively on a small number of company-led projects and initiatives.\n\nOur Projects\n\nSo what types of projects will you be working on?\n\n\n* A custom e-commerce site built in React and Next, powered on the back-end by Firebase and WordPress\n\n* A custom admin dashboard for a native app with more than 250,000 user accounts and 5,000 daily users, built in React and Next, and powered by Firebase\n\n* A shopify e-commerce site with a custom theme built on Shopify&rsquo;s themekit and React\n\n* An app microsite built in React and Next, powered by Firebase\n\n* Various landing pages and microsites generally built in React and Next, powered by Firebase and\/or WordPress as a CMS\n\n* Internal reporting and communication tools that may need some FED love\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Grind\n\nWhat&rsquo;s a typical day for a FED? We work in sprints; so, you&rsquo;ll be in daily communication with your dev team members and leadership. But we also work like animals; so, you&rsquo;ll be free to focus on getting your work done. Your week will begin with a Sprint Planning Meeting, you&rsquo;ll have daily stand-ups during the week, and it will end on Friday with a Sprint Review.\n\nThough most of your time during the week will be working on tasks and bugs, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to step up regularly (if that&rsquo;s your thing) and be involved in higher-level design and direction decisions. We say &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s your thing&rdquo; because some people love that, others don&rsquo;t. And we want you focused mostly on what you love.\n\nBut What Am I Really Doing?\n\nSometimes, you&rsquo;ll have an entire Sketch design and you&rsquo;ll be building out the FED. Other times, you&rsquo;ll have the basic design requirements (fonts, colors, etc) and some functionality requirements (credit card form, shipping address), and you&rsquo;ll design and build the page or component in browser.\n\nYou&rsquo;ll also handle FED for A\/B tests like changing button colors or page layouts. Or we&rsquo;ll need some animation on a page, like firing off confetti when a form is submitted. That&rsquo;s your area too.\n\nHey - we just added some new functionality to how subscriptions are set up or we&rsquo;re building out the functionality to export customer lists from our admin portal. You&rsquo;ll FED those components, and also bug fix them should something break or not work as expected.\n\nOur Tech Stack\n\nYou must know React. We use React heavily in our front end development. You must also be great - not good, great - with CSS, SCSS, or some similar styling. We currently use SCSS modules in React, so you should be comfortable with SCSS even if you want to convince us that something better exists.\n\nYou must also have a great - not good, great - eye for CSS animations, timings, transitions...everything animated in the browser. If we (or you) get a crazy idea to animate a user interaction or drop in a little delighter, you&rsquo;ll be the one to pull it off.\n\nExperience with Firebase, WordPress, and\/or Shopify is a plus.

Do animations, interactions, and user experiences delight you? Are you disciplined enough to work in sprints, but also mature enough to work independently?\n\nUndefined LLC is hiring a full-time FED to work on customer-facing and internal websites and web applications. Say goodbye to the agency or freelance rat race - you&rsquo;ll be working exclusively on a small number of company-led projects and initiatives.\n\nOur Projects\n\nSo what types of projects will you be working on?\n\n\n* A custom e-commerce site built in React and Next, powered on the back-end by Firebase and WordPress\n\n* A custom admin dashboard for a native app with more than 250,000 user accounts and 5,000 daily users, built in React and Next, and powered by Firebase\n\n* A shopify e-commerce site with a custom theme built on Shopify&rsquo;s themekit and React\n\n* An app microsite built in React and Next, powered by Firebase\n\n* Various landing pages and microsites generally built in React and Next, powered by Firebase and/or WordPress as a CMS\n\n* Internal reporting and communication tools that may need some FED love\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Grind\n\nWhat&rsquo;s a typical day for a FED? We work in sprints; so, you&rsquo;ll be in daily communication with your dev team members and leadership. But we also work like animals; so, you&rsquo;ll be free to focus on getting your work done. Your week will begin with a Sprint Planning Meeting, you&rsquo;ll have daily stand-ups during the week, and it will end on Friday with a Sprint Review.\n\nThough most of your time during the week will be working on tasks and bugs, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to step up regularly (if that&rsquo;s your thing) and be involved in higher-level design and direction decisions. We say &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s your thing&rdquo; because some people love that, others don&rsquo;t. And we want you focused mostly on what you love.\n\nBut What Am I Really Doing?\n\nSometimes, you&rsquo;ll have an entire Sketch design and you&rsquo;ll be building out the FED. Other times, you&rsquo;ll have the basic design requirements (fonts, colors, etc) and some functionality requirements (credit card form, shipping address), and you&rsquo;ll design and build the page or component in browser.\n\nYou&rsquo;ll also handle FED for A/B tests like changing button colors or page layouts. Or we&rsquo;ll need some animation on a page, like firing off confetti when a form is submitted. That&rsquo;s your area too.\n\nHey - we just added some new functionality to how subscriptions are set up or we&rsquo;re building out the functionality to export customer lists from our admin portal. You&rsquo;ll FED those components, and also bug fix them should something break or not work as expected.\n\nOur Tech Stack\n\nYou must know React. We use React heavily in our front end development. You must also be great - not good, great - with CSS, SCSS, or some similar styling. We currently use SCSS modules in React, so you should be comfortable with SCSS even if you want to convince us that something better exists.\n\nYou must also have a great - not good, great - eye for CSS animations, timings, transitions...everything animated in the browser. If we (or you) get a crazy idea to animate a user interaction or drop in a little delighter, you&rsquo;ll be the one to pull it off.\n\nExperience with Firebase, WordPress, and/or Shopify is a plus. And if you use After Effects or Lottie to blow peoples&rsquo; minds, we want to know (and see it).\n\nWhat You Need To Qualify\n\nThis is a full-time position or contract-to-hire position depending on your situation and needs. To qualify:\n\n\n* Must be a US citizen or resident alien\n\n* Proven work experience as a FED with React\n\n* Proficiency working in git and terminal\n\n* A portfolio and/or repo of actual work experience\n\n\n\n\nHow To Apply\n\nSend us your details - we need to see your work and resume or similar doc. We&rsquo;ll reach out to qualified candidates via email to ask some questions or for a phone conversation.</div></div><div class="instructions"><p style="text-align:center">See more jobs at <a target="_new" href="/remote-companies/undefined">Undefined</a></p><a class="button action-apply" href="/l/76412" target="_new" rel="nofollow">Apply for this Job</a><p style="font-size:0.85em"><strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here!</strong><br /><br />When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply.
